            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is an Aphoriſme among Phyſitians, whoſe ſtudy only tends to the preſervation of the Naturall body, that if a fluxe of ſharp humours fall upon the eye, or any ſuch tender part, that if by fit purgative medicines they cannot carry it away, the ſtream muſt be turned, and the matter tranſported to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ordinary neighbour Emunctories: And many wiſe Commanders, whoſe care extends it ſelfe to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the body politique in peace, have followed this Rule, That when the Armies of aliens in hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall invade their territories, the only expeditious way<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3195:8"/>of ſecuring their own, is to fall upon the Enemies land, that ſo hee may be called home, and diverted from his former counſels. Thus <hi>Pericles</hi> in the Peloponneſian war, twice, and both times ſpeedily, and happily delivered the Athenians countrey from the formidable Hoſte of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Thus <hi>Agathocles</hi> the King, oppoſing feare to feare, and force to force, conveighing his Army by ſea into Africa, ſuddenly raiſed the Siege of Syracuſa, when <hi>Amilcar</hi> was ſet down before it, the Carthagenians being conſtrainedly willing to purchaſe their ſafety, with the quiet of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thus
<hi>Hannibal</hi> when the Romanes had ſo ſtrongly planted themſelves before Capua, that hee eſteemed it a matter of extream difficultie, if not impoſsibility to remove them by force, brought his Army to the gates of Rome, deeming this the ſureſt way to quit his friends from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger: and this device was ſo ſucceſſeful, that <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> one of the Conſuls, was inſtantly ſent for home from Capua, for the reliefe of the Citie. And the D. attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted about <hi>May</hi> 27. <hi>Iune</hi> 6. to deliver the Citie of Regens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg from the fury of the beſiegers, by an inroade into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia, pillaging and ſpoiling the enemies countrey, blocking up one place, beſieging another, and doing him what dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they could in every place. And this courſe of his was the cauſe that about <hi>Iune</hi>
11/1 ſome Imperiall Regiments were ſent back into Bohemia, to aſſure that Country againſt the Proteſtants, &amp; ſome of the Bavarians Army marched down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Strawbingen into Bavaria to ſecure thoſe coaſts from invaſion.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3195:8"/>and ſufficient ammunition to beſiege it, who ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his office there, that by <hi>Iune</hi> 5/15 he had made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the very walls neere the Shiniger ſteeple, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Army from the danger of the Canon, and much diſcouraged them within the Fort, who were not onely hemm'd in by Enemies without, but pincht and ready to faint, for want of water within.</p>
            <p>Thence hee marched with the reſt of his Army to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaim, a Citie which had not onely formerly ſupplyed the Caſtle of Wilsburg, when it was beſieged by the Swediſh Colonell <hi>Sperreuter,</hi> and Landgrave
<hi>Iohn</hi> of Heſſen: but now alſo is a neſt of trouble ſome gueſts to their Neighbours, daily doing much harme about Megeldorff, Gleishammer, and the places thereabouts, by pillaging.

               </note> We cannot here paſſe over a memorable adventure of a Swediſh Serjeant, whoſe name though it be not diſcovered to us, is worthy to be recorded for his valour and wiſedome. Some ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men have done ſtrange things caſually, but few by praee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and judgement; but this man ſhewed as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in the proſecution of his deſigne, as boldneſſe in the firſt undertaking; The ſtory is briefly thus: About <hi>Iune</hi> 1/11.
400 foot, and 80 Horſe of the Imperialiſts at Forchaim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid a bridge over the river of Pegnitz above Megell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorff, went a bootehaling, in the Country thereabouts, and had drove away many of their cattell. This Serjeant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with two Horſemen, as he was comming to the D. underſtanding of it by chance, aſſociates himſelfe with them immediately, profeſſing himſelfe to be an Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, till the whole company being divided to ſeek for more prey, be (under pretence of a faire bootie) had drawne out a Standard, and an Enſigne ſo far fromt he reſt, that hee had ſufficient opportunity to diſpatch his firſt intended buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And now having thus ſurpriſed them, hee diſcloſes himſelfe, tells them plainly what hee is, a Swede and their enemie; ſets upon them when they looked for no ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and had killed them preſently, bad not they<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3195:9"/>craved Quartier. But this ſuddain unexpected change of his words and behaviour, made them petition for their lives, which he granted upon their diſarming, giving up their Piſtols, and ſubmitting themſelves to his command. This act of his, could not be done ſo ſecretly, but that it muſt needs, and was in the end diſcovered to the reſt of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall party; and therefore about 20 of them preſently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after him, as wel to avenge themſelves upon the Swede, who had thus deluded them, as to recover the Standard, and Enſigne. But he who had gotten a pretty advantage of way before them, poſts on with his prize and priſoners toward Noremberg, whither at laſt, being happily preſerved by the fortunate comming in of ſome Musketiers from the Suburb of Werth, who were marching againſt theſe boote-halers, and the Boores of the Country, who had taken up Armes, and were come together to ſave their cattell, which by this meanes were regained: he ſpeedile arrived, bringing in the priſoners, the Standard, and Enſigne, which the next day were preſented to the Duke, who with the Field-Marſhall <hi>Horne</hi> was come thither
<hi>Iune</hi> 2/12 that with their preſence they might honour the funeralls of the Generall Major <hi>Corville,</hi> who was ſlaine by a wyer-bullet before Regens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg (as we have related in the ſupplement to the ſixth part of this Hiſtorie) and was after the Military manner honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably buried in the Suburbs of Werth, Iune 5/15. The Standard had on the one ſide the picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> on the other, an hand reaching out of a cloud, and the Enſigne was blue, and white, which this adventurous Serjeant thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved. A ſtrange attempt, and hardly to be paralleld in Hiſtory. Neither the fact of <hi>Zopirus</hi> in bringing the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to his maſter <hi>Darius</hi> his ſubjection, nor the ſtratagem of
<hi>Hannibal</hi> in taking in the Romane Cities by his Africans, whom he had caused to be perfectly inſtruſted in the Latine tongue, and dreſſed in the Roman garbe; nor the device of our owne Countrymen in the yeare 1388, in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, by entring and taking the towne of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3195:9"/>Mont-ferrat in the lower Auvergne under the ſhew of merchants, being every way comparable to it: <hi>Zopirus</hi> by mangling his face, and falſe tale, had brought the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans into ſuch a fooles paradiſe, that they could not thinke, but that he was at tearmes of enmity with his maſter, and would take occaſion of vengeance; The device of
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was rather an evidence of a cunning, reaching head, than valiant man; and the deſigne of our Nation, was without ſhew of perill, there being many undertakers, and the town unfortified, &amp; without a Garriſon, diſable to reſiſt them; But this man ſingly expoſing himſelfe to certaine death if once diſcovered, gave a good teſtimony aſwell of his valour as policie. And doubtleſſe he was well inſtructed in his Shib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth, being not onely perfect in the Enemies language, but able to conform himſelf, to their behaviour, &amp; geſture.</p>

Their diſputations on both ſides are with ſhot and ſword, and the oppoſitions of the one are not more fierce and fiery, then the anſwers of the other are round and ſpeedy.</p>
            <p>In what eſtate the D. <hi>Bernhard</hi> left the Citie, wee have formerly declared; we wil not now look behind us to what was then, but before us to what is done ſince.</p>
            <p>Divers aſſaults had the Imperialiſts made upon the citie, before the 17.27. of <hi>lune,</hi> wherein they gained ſo little, that as yet they could not be maſters of ſo much as one outwork, though with the loſſe, and lives of many thouſands of men, whereof ſome part was ſlaine before the towne, another taken priſoners, and the third ranne away, and ſtarved; it ſee me that they came on deſperately, and were repulſed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly. Thus we are informed in generall, but to give the Reader the more ſatisfaction, wee ſhall put downe ſome memorable particulars.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the Imperiall and Bavarian Armies were jointly ſet downe before this citie, with about 150 peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they firſt battered that place of the wall, where D.<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3195:10"/>
               <hi>Bernhard</hi> firſt made the breach, when he took it; but finding the event not to anſwer their expectation, their Army being thus quartered, in Regiments, in all making
6000, whereof 2000 were Musquettiers, placed on the North ſide of the Donaw; neere the Ship-bridge; 7 Regiments of Foot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 5000 men, under the command of the Generall <hi>Altringer</hi> on the Bavarian, or Southſide,
6 companies under the command of <hi>Gallas;</hi> 7 companies of Dragooners under <hi>Piccolomini:</hi> 9 companies of Pollacks; and 2 of Prench at Kalmuncz; 15 companies of Cuiraſſiers, at Swandorff, 3 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments conſiſting of 16 companies, 6 companies under the command of Colonell
<hi>Hummerton,</hi> and 8 under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Colonell <hi>Butler</hi> at Smidhalen. Upon Whitſunday May 25. June 4. when they continued playing with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non upon the City, and the horneworke, till 4 in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, they made 3 ſeverall aſſaults upon the horneworke, which though it was not built to the full perfection, was couragiouſly defended by Count
<hi>Thurn</hi> and his ſoldiers, whoſe valour that day was not ſo commended by his friends, as admired by his enemies. The loſſe the Garriſon had in theſe aſſaults, was not great, compared to that of the Imperialiſts: they loſt not above 12 men, amongſt which were none of note: the other many, the number is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; amonſt which was the Baron of Teubrize, who had formerly been Commander in that Citie while it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of Bavaria, who with the Generall Major <hi>Dietrichſtein,</hi> Colonell <hi>Iulidado,</hi> and other principall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, was ſlain, Colonel <hi>Breuner,</hi> who was firſt wounded in three ſeverall places, and afterward with <hi>Mariams</hi> Lieutenant Colonell, the Major of
<hi>Colloredoes</hi> Regiment, and other Officers of note in the Army were taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>Theſe three were the moſt furious aſſaults, which the Imperialiſts have hitherto made againſt the City: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy events whereof, made them afterwards to goe on more warily, and to endevour by mynes and more ſecure<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3195:11"/>means to compaſſe their deſires. And herein the defendants apply themſelves to defeat them in their manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, unwinding the clue as faſt as the other make it up, countermining againſt them, to undoe what the other have done.

<hi>Iune</hi> 10.20. appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without the Hornworke, as if they meant againe to have done the like: whence preſently as afraid of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, they retired purpoſely toward the towne, to draw the Imperialiſts to purſue them, to the outworks, where they had placed ſome field-pieces, charged wich ſmall ſhot, for the ſlaughter of the aſſaylants, if they ſhould chance to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. And this device tooke ſuch effect, that the Camp being incouraged, by this (as they conceived) timorous flight purſued them to the very outworke, where theſe Murderers being diſcharged upon them, made ſuch a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, that many of them there loſt their lives, to the great diſcouragement of the Army, and incouragement of the Regensburgers. It is good to looke before we leap; policie is often ſuperiour to power, and wiſdome prevaileth againſt unregulated might.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have diſcourſed but of the beginning of this ſiege, the proceedings whereof (with the want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proviſions for that numerous Army before it) have been terrible, and many Well-willers to the Evangelicall party, have been perſwaded, that before this time, the King of Hungarie would have riſen from before the Citie: But he who is reſolved either to take it or ſpend himſelf before it, ſtill maketh great preparations againſt it, and hath ſent for 9 whole Canons, and 2000 barrells of powder, from Brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, in Bavaria, and 4000 weights of all ſorts of Ammunition<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3195:11"/>to be brought unto him out of Bohemia and Auſtria.</p>

6.16. being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to march out without Enſigns, or weapons, to the great offence of the Duke, both becauſe he had not firſt burnt the Ship-bridge, as alſo for that he held not out one day longer; which if he had done, he had certainly been relieved. The ſurpriſall of Sultzbach was quickly avenged by the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls at Amberg in the upper Palatinat, who preſently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſet upon 4 companies of the Weymariſh Horſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them, and tooke from them 3 Standards, and the moſt part of their Baggage: And this action againe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by the Swediſh Garriſon in Weygen, which defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Imperiall convoy, which was going with 40 Wagons loaden with victuals, to the Imperiall Army at Regensburg, and carried away the proviſion: The Dye falls not alwayes alike, Gameſters muſt expect to loſe, as well as to win, and the fortune of war, doth not alwayes carry the ſame face: A lowring evening hath ſometimes ſeen him a Captive, whom a glorious flattering morning hath laughed on, as a Conqueror.</p>

It was then in vaine to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Saylors, who were gone out of reach; the Councell of war therefore made inquiry after him, who was in their power, arraigned, and hanged him. An excellent piece of juſtice; The very name of treaſon is abominable, and though it diſcover a malitious mind, and inclination to doe evill, yet it is not alwayes ſeconded with the occaſion, and power of execution; wilfull negligence in matters of importance, is almoſt, if not altogether, as bad; for hereby the adverſary hath fit opportunity of doing what miſchiefe hee can deſire.

                  <p> VVHereas I perceived, that the Enemy did ſtrengthen himſelfe more and more, with an intention to releeve Rhinefelden; I conſulted with my ſelfe (your Excellency by letters having firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me thereunto) how I might defeat his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and prevent his deſigne. To this end after I had ſent abroad many Spies, at laſt intelligence was brought me that they lay on an hill, which though it was ſteepe, and not to be paſſed without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet then the paſſage was more open, then it had been formerly, when beſides the acclivitie of the place, the way was ſtopped up, by trees which were cut downe purpoſely, and laid athwart it, to make it unpaſſeable. Wherefore I diſlodged the laſt wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday night July 11.21. with ſixe companies of your Life Regiment, the 5. Meckelburghiſh troops, the 12. companies of Straſborough muſketiers; ſome fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen, &amp; 60. Benfeldiſh Muſketiers (in all about 4000. men) and tooke my way directly againſt the mountaine. Here while the Margyraffiſh Boores, (who were the firſt which diſcovered to me the place of the Enemies abode) and the Lackeyes, fired ſome houſes, opened the paſſage, and chaſed away the watch which kept it, the Enemie who lay but 2. houres march from thence, got notice of our comming, and as well as time permitted, fortified himſelfe againſt us. Hereupon I commanded the Count of Naſſaw, with 6. Companies, to advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but hee perceiving our forces, left his Quarters, and went to the cloiſter of S. Blaſius,<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3195:15"/>cutting downe the trees in the Forreſt as hee went, to impeach our ſpeedy paſſage after him. This acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his much hindered, but made us not give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our courſe, our hard labour undid what hee had done, and we followed him, which thought none had purſued him. At the Cloiſter our Horſemen firſt appeared, which when the Enemy ſaw alone, thinking them to bee unbackt, and not ſuccoured with foot, he made towards them ſo furiouſly, that he cauſed them to retire, with the loſſe of 4. of their companie. The foot were by this come, and brought in, whom aſſoone as he had deſcryed, hee left the Cloyſter againe, and betooke himſelfe to an hill, thinking verily, ſo to eſcape, and retire to <hi>Villenguen,</hi> and in his flight to ſurpriſe the Colonell <hi>Gaſsion,</hi> who was quartered in a ſmall Dorp, by the way. I ſuſpected his meaning, and followed him at the heeles; but by climbing up the hills, our forces, as well as his, eſpecially the Horſemen (a thing to be wondered at) ſo wearied themſelves, that neither man, nor Horſe (of which many were killed by hard riding) were able to goe a ſtep farther. I know not how it came to paſſe, (nor can I aſcribe it to any other cauſe, but his providence, which diſpoſeth all things) at laſt the Enemy craved Quarter, which being granted by us as willingly, as begged by them humbly the Lieutenant Colonell of Shonaw Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all the forces, althe Officers, which came from Bryſſack (whoſe names are under written) and above 300. common ſouldiers, were by us taken priſoners. And thus (God be thanked) this Army which intended the ſuccour of Rhinefelden, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3195:15"/>ruined, and diſperſed, and no offices eſcaped, except
2. Lieutenants, which ſtill were foremoſt in the flight, and (I think) would have beene laſt in battell. The Villinguenieres, were purſued by the wearied horſe, and men, as faſt as they could, and ſome of them put to the ſword, many of them lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from their horſes, and hid themſelves in the hedges, and ditches, the reſt, (as the Lantgrave of Stulingen certifieth) fled as faſt as ever they could towards. Villinguen, without ſo much as looking backe. The Forreſt, and the Hills were the refuges of them which eſcaped, for could we have brought them into the open field, few, either of horſe, or foot, had eſcaped our hands, though by thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and flight, ſome have for the preſent, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.

            <p>This defeature hath not onely much diſcouraged them at Rhinefelden, but at Bryſſack alſo, for ſo they write from Colmar, an Imperiall citie in the upper Alſatia, diſtant from Bryſſack about 8.

Horſes, and that the officers had rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Ship, and intended to eſcape by the River; this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation diverted him from his firſt adviſe; and inſtead of attempting any thing upon the towne, he put forth many veſſels well manned to the Rhine, to attend there, if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhould attempt that way, to evade him. The Bryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackers, though they have a ſtrong garriſon, yet knowing that the activity of the Souldiers dependeth upon their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are much dejected, becauſe their chiefe Commanders are ſurprized, and may not returne from Colmar, (whither they were brought after the laſt action) to doe them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And now we may briefly ſee the generall eſtate of the upper Alſatia, much diſtracted by theſe warres, and the particular eſtate of Rhinefelden, much diſtreſſed, and that of Bryſſack much perplexed.</p>

Buckhorne a little towne, but of much importance, neere this Lake, is daily ſtrengthened, by the Swedes, with new fortifications. Here are many Ship-wrights ſet on worke, to make men of warre, after the faſhion of the Hollanders, twelve whereof were finiſhed about the beginning of June, which ſince have done ſo much harme to the Imperialiſts thereabouts, and put them to ſuch feare, that they dare no longer rove abroad at Sea, as they have done formerly, but are faine to ſolicite the neighbouring Romiſhly-affected Sea-townes againſt theſe Enemies, who now appeare as terrible upon the water, as they have beene formerly, at land;

<hi>Cratz,</hi> together with the Generall Major <hi>Kagge,</hi> and ſome
<hi>Durlachiſh</hi> forces arrived not farre from the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Armie, whereupon Duke <hi>Bernhard</hi> tooke againe the reſolution to fight; On Tueſday, being the 25. of <hi>Aug.</hi> the 5. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> they conjoyned their forces, and ſent the Baggage ſomewhat backe, and about Evening they advanced into the Valley under <hi>Goppingen,</hi> halfe a league from the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Campe, whereupon I intreated and obtained it, that I might go to the Baggage, for if ſo be that any of the
<hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſhould ſee me, they ſhould not know, in what manner I had come hither; this day the <hi>Mechelburgiſh</hi> Regiment was defeated by the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,</hi> and the halfe part of the Fieldmarſhall
<hi>Cratz</hi> his Baggage was plundred. This day was ſevennight being the

<hi>Zepherene</hi> Pope and Martyr, the <hi>Swedes</hi> very early before 6. of the clocke aſſaulted the <hi>Imperiall</hi> entrenched Armie with great furie, obtained 2. Standards, and 2.

<hi>Imperiall</hi> Regiments, and ruinated. As for the horſemen, the Duke of
<hi>Wirttenberg</hi> himſelfe writes to his Officers, that 2000. of them were ſlaine upon the very place: of the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces, few or none eſcaped, except thoſe that remained about the Baggage, which tooke the horſes from the waggons, and ſaved themſelues upon them, the reſt were either put to the ſword or taken priſoners; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Swedes,</hi> above 4000.
<hi>Wirttenbergs</hi> of the trained band were put to the ſword, the enemies Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ammunition, and all their waggons together with Duke
<hi>Bernhards</hi> beſt goods were apprehended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Nereſſen:</hi> and they themſelues confeſſe, that they have loſt above 4000. waggons, loaden with Baggage, proviſion, and ammunition; hence it may eaſtly be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how many 1000. horſes our forces obtained. The whole
<hi>Swediſh</hi> Armie together with the <hi>Wirttenbergs</hi> Boores was ſtrong about 22000. men, of which ſome 1000. horſemen fled to the
<hi>Coppinger</hi> Valley, where the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> arrived, and conioyned his troopes with them, and made up an Armie of 5. or 6000. horſemen without Foot-forces, ordnances, Baggages, or ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which they nothing left; which way the ſame turned, and what end it tooke, with the purſuite after them, I do not know, for when I ſaw all ſouldiers to betake themſelues to flight, I did the like, and the ſame<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3195:36"/>night I came to the Fort of <hi>Shorendorff,</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Wirttenberg,</hi> where the General Commiſſaries <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers</hi> ſervant, and both the Commanders <hi>Tupadels</hi> and <hi>Obms</hi> wiues were yet the ſame night fetched and carried to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> in ſo much that they are not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to maintaine that ſtrong Fort.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday in the morning, the relation was brought of thoſe high officers that were ſlaine and wounded, which I will relate not for certaine, but as I have heard it. Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Weymar</hi> was ſhot through one of his armes, the Landtgrave <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Heſſen,</hi> was wounded in his face and in his necke, and fled bloudy to <hi>Vlm,</hi> Field-Marſhall <hi>Horne</hi> is dead or taken priſoner, becauſe he is not found amongſt them. Field-Marſhall <hi>Cratz</hi> is dead, Generall Major <hi>Vitz dumb</hi> dead, Generall Major <hi>Kagge</hi> dead, Colonell <hi>Watchtmaiſter</hi> dead, which was very famous amongſt them, Colonell <hi>Liebenſtein</hi> dead, Colonell Lievetenant <hi>Grun</hi> dead, Colonell Lievetenant <hi>Willibardt</hi> dead. When I rode forward on Thurſday, I found the high waies towards <hi>Stutgard,</hi> full of fleeing ſouldiers and inhabitants. The Duke of <hi>Wirttenberg</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted yet the ſome day in all haſte towards <hi>Strasburg,</hi> all Noble and rich men followed him thither, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ranne out of the Cities, carrying onely their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their armes, with great lamentation and crying, and when I asked them, whither they intended to goe, they anſwered, God knowes it, we doe not know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to runne in ſuch a haſte: they cryed ſtill woe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver woe that the <hi>Swedes</hi> came into the Empire, afore we could treate with compoſition; now all goes to ruine: the Imperialiſts had behaved themſelves very well in <hi>Shorendorff,</hi> but the <hi>Swedes</hi> now and the Counſell at <hi>Franckford</hi> had their monies and goods, and would now depart and leave them in ſuch a miſery.</p>
            <p>Our Armie doubtleſſe poſſeſſeth now the moſt part of the Country of <hi>Wirttenberg,</hi> they finde in it an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of Corne and Wine, of which they have<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3195:37"/>

The Field-Marſhall <hi>Horne</hi> himſelfe ſpoke to me, that in the Country of <hi>Wirttenberg,</hi> 1500000 Commiſſe bread were baken for them, which will doe now much good to the Imperiall Armie. <hi>Nordlingen</hi> muſt now needs ſurrender on diſcretion, in which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3000 horſes which were brought thither from the Country to ſave them, of which our ſouldiers will make good booty, and the great quantity of corne that is in it, will ſerve for the victualling of
<hi>Ingolſtatt.</hi> In <hi>Augſpurg</hi> is already great famine, they eate dogs and cats. The Granarie of the Citie of <hi>Vlm</hi> namely the Country of <hi>Wirttenberg</hi> is no ſo exhauſted, that thoſe Cities will be forced to creepe to the Croſſe: all the Garriſons were taken out of all places about the <hi>Rhine,</hi> except <hi>Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and the ſouldiers ſent to the Swediſh Armie, and now they are maſſacred, and they themſelves confeſſe, that they cannot bring together againe ſo many foot-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to forme a new Army. All this I have partly ſeene with mine owne eyes, partly heard it of many chiefe men of their owne, which I thought to relate according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus this Catholike Gallant with a large preface of himſelfe, writes gloriouſly of his owne adventure, and the victory, adding ſomething peradventure to the tale, which is delivered otherwiſe in the next diſcourſe, which is as followeth.</p>

In the meane time a part of the Swediſh foot forces laboured to maſter a Sconce, in which the enemy had planted three Demicanons together with ſome ſmall pieces, and did with them more harme to the Swedes, than the Swedes could do vnto them, by reaſon they had the lower ground, after many ſharpe and bloudy skirmiſhes, the Swediſh forces did beat the enemy out of the ſaid ſconce. But being by reaſon of their improvidence, the powder that was preſent there happened on fire againſt al hope: the Swediſh ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers receiued not a ſmall hurt by it; yea, ſuch a harme, that they were forced to abandon the ſame againe; and upon the fierce aſſaulting of the enemie, to retire againe to the Swedliſh armie, that ſtood in battell ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray. Whereupon the enemy with his continuall ſhooting out of his ordnances from his batteries, put the Swedes ſo hard to it, that after that they had loſt a great many of their officers and ſouldiers, it was thought beſt of all to retire in good order a little way off from the hill, downe into the valley, where they might bee free a little of the force of the ememies Canons.</p>
                        <p>In the meane time 100 men of every Brigade or Regiment of foot with a good Officer, and horſemen adioyning on both ſides were commanded to mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3195:40"/>the place, where the Swediſh ſtood, till under the favor of the ſame, they had gained a firm ground in the vnlley, and then theſe that were left behinde to maintaine the place, might the better retire towards them. But the enemy perceiving their intent, commanded on the right ſide ſome Regiments of Crabats, and on the left ſide the Spaniſh forces to out off the paſſage from them which aſſaulted them, who were left to maintaine the place ſo furiouſly, that by reaſon of the ſituation of the place, none could ſecond the other, but fell into a confuſion, and every one began to ſave himſelfe as well as he could, and retire towards the woods. By which confuſion, they loſt together with the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the moſt part of the Enſignes and Baggages. The enemy purſued after the fleeing Swedes with ſome 1000 Crabats; but becauſe his Excellence the Rhinegrave <hi>Otto Ludwig</hi> with his forces was nigh at hand to conioyne with the Swediſh forces, the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats retired, and put up the purſuit of the Swediſh forces.</p>

<hi>Torgaw,</hi> holding him worthy of that Province which the other did eſteeme him deſervedly deprived of, for ſome pretended offence.

            <p>All this buſineſſe in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> was onely yet in conception, things were not yet brought to maturitie, ſome hope of agreement was yet remaining, both parties were allyed to two puiſſant Princes, the Proteſtants, to the <hi>French,</hi> who had commanded his agents to divide his penſions onely to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the other to the Catholick K. who as it is reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred formerly in the larger hiſtory, had made a ſpeciall league with them; <hi>Otho Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowicke</hi> was not yet called, to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> but ingaged by order from the director General to ſtay at home, and ioyne with the Duke of <hi>Saxon Weymar</hi>

The iſſue of the Leaguiſh hopes, the effects of the Embaſſage, the Military actions on both parts, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes attending them, as farre as they have gone, and we have underſtood of them ſince, muſt be the ſubiect of this relation.</p>

               <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mansfield, Generaliſſimo</hi> of the leaguiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, being come in perſon to <hi>Boone,</hi> May 25, Iune 4, was ſent for thence with a ſtrong convoy to come to <hi>Collen,</hi> to conferre with the Elector, about relieving the army, which being hemmed in at
<hi>Munſter,</hi> by the <hi>Haſſians</hi> and <hi>Luneburghers</hi> were as much neceſſitated by famin, as threatned by their enemies ſword. And here was no time for a long conſultation, an expeditious action was the onely meanes to reſcue them; and to doe this affectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, more power was required, than could be levied by the Leaguers inſtantly. Therefore the Earle who had a generall Imperiall Commiſſion to leavie Forces (if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion required) to oppoſe the Princes, and to cal to the Catholickes to aſſiſt him with their auxiliary powers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given order to his Commiſſaries to muſter up the ſouldiers enquartered about <hi>Hauff,</hi> upper
<hi>Caſſell,</hi> and the places adioyning.

Your Highneſſe cannot bee ignorant of the miſerable condition, not of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> only, but all Germany, and the ſacred Roman Empire. I cannot thinke of it my ſelfe without a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull paſſion; nor can I conceive that any other, who hath not put on the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſtupidity can heare it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſion.</p>
            <p>The enemies of the Romane Church and Empire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a confederation againſt his Imperiall Maieſty, his Catholicke friends and Allies, doe not onely make their inrodes into our territories, but ſtrive to lay our dwellings waſte and deprive us of our inheritance; and whether it was through our feare and ſluggiſhneſſe, or their courage and forwardneſſe, I know not, their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt us have been ſo unfortunate to us that our armies have turned their backs to theſe enemies: the ſame troupes which once were fed with the prey, and cloathed with the ſpoyle of theſe Adverſaries, have lately been made a prey to them, and Victory which formerly attended the Romane Eagles, now waites upon their Standards, and hath taken up an Habitation in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villions. I need not tell you, how ſince the firſt comming in of the Swedes, we have bin incroacht upon in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> waſted in <hi>Franconia,</hi> ruined in
<hi>Pomerania,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and
<hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the D. of <hi>Saxon Weymar,</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi> the
<hi>Rhinegrave,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> and the united forces of theſe Swediſh ſtrangers: It is too well known to the Chriſtian world, I wiſh it never had been publiſhed in <hi>Gath,</hi> or
<hi>Askelon</hi> among the Turks and Mahometan Haggarenes. But in theſe regions, my ſelfe had no particular ingagement, I am onely bound to pitty their deplorable condition, nor to give account of them. Let them anſwer for it, to whoſe<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3195:49"/>cuſtody they were deputed.
<hi>Weſtphalia</hi> is my particular Province, committed to my truſt, as well by his Sacred Imperiall Maieſtie, as the Spirituall Lords, the Electors and Princes of the catholicke League. For the defence of this Countrey; I ſhall willingly hazard mine owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and imploy my forces, not doubting of the beſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my Catholicke friends, (whereof your Highnes is not the leaſt) who profeſſing with mee one and the ſame religion, cannot (in probability) bee diuided from me in affection. And now by the file of my diſcourſe, you may eaſily perceive the intent of my coming hither, not to befor a formall viſitation, but the tranſmiſſion of your army to our Leaguiſh forces, who being much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed at this preſent, might themſelves ſoone be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the comming in of your auxiliaries, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks of <hi>Paderhorne,</hi> and
<hi>Iſnabrug</hi> lately loſt by us, and gained by the Swedes and Haſſians, peradventure be happily recovered. I have ſaid, and now expect a quick and effectuall anſwer, without delay or denyall, if not in politicall reſpect of your owne conſervation; for aſſure your ſelfe in this Neutrality, whether we ſtand or fal, you cannot bee ſafe; yet in reſpect of pietie, for I know your Highneſſe to be no <hi>Meroziri,</hi> and would not be lyable to the curſe of the Angell, for not going forth to the battell which is for the propagation and defence of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Religion.</p>
            <p>This was the ſpeech of the Count <hi>Philip</hi> to the Duke, who after a ſhort pauſe thus replied.

What you would perſwade me unto by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and piety, experience and reaſon diſſwade me from: The extremities which a neighbour Prince, the Biſhop of
<hi>Wirtzburg,</hi> lately ſuffered, by conjoyning his forces with the Imperiall, when in providence he ſhould have kept them for conſervation of his own eſtate, may teach all after ages to ſtand upon their owne guard, and not to weaken themſelves, to ſupport a Confederate; it was not the titular dignitie of the Duke of <hi>Franconia,</hi> nor his defenced Citie fortified with ditches, walls, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, nor his (ſuppoſed impregnable) Caſtle, that could ſecure him againſt forreine invaſion, ſo long as his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers continued with him, he was free from danger, but their abſence diſarmed him, and expoſed him to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, which ſtraight purſued him eagerly, and overtooke him ſpeedily. I have reſolved, from this precedent, to ward cloſe, and not to lye open, when I may prevent it; if unexpected miſchiefe attend this reſolution, it is but in doubtfull expectation: time, friends, and meanes may make my peace; which I am certaine would be-loſt by (your adviſed) alteration. And yet I would have my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie to ſerve, not overrule my pietie, and may they ſow wheat, and reape bryars, which will not go forth to the battell of the Lord with the mightie, if it be required by neceſſitie, and may be done with ſafetie: but the firſt condition of theſe (I hope) is not yours, the laſt (I am ſure) is not mine: my Countrey is little, and not ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous as thence to raiſe two Armies, one to attend you, and another to guard it, and if I could raiſe them, I have not meanes to keepe them, it being no fit ſeaſon to plant, or ſow, or reape, during the time of ſuch warre-like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. I muſt conclude, I ſpeake it ſorrowfully, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I ſpeake it poſitively, I will not herein condeſcend to your deſire; My good wiſhes ſhall go along with you; may the ſtarres from Heaven fight for you, may the ſtars<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3195:50"/>fight in their courſes againſt the Enemies of the Romane Church, and Empire, but mine Army, I muſt, and will keepe at home, for mine owne conſervation.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Luneburgh</hi> was all this while before

<hi>Munſter.</hi>
               </note> who having firſt taken his oath of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the <hi>Lants-grave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen</hi> was advanced by him, to the office of his Lieutenant Generall, while his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency at <hi>Franckefort</hi> negotiates himſelfe, with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, in the friendly correſpondence and agreement of the Circle of the Lower <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and the reſt of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at the
<hi>Diet</hi> there.</p>
            <p>The time thus ſpent was not loſt; His receſſe from the Army was not frivolous, it had beene vaine either for himſelfe, or the other Princes, to have fought abroad in the Generall cauſe, if there had beene diſſention at home: But by his endeavours the Evangelicall States, were accorded at <hi>Franckeford,</hi> and an univerſall hope of proſperous ſucceſſe in the warre, was conceived to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this union.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luneburg</hi> reſted without doing any thing till the ſoure dayes, the time ſet downe, for the Cities anſwer to his propoſitions was expired; and then finding that the Articles were not accepted (as in all probabilitie they would not) the ſtrength which was left of the Leaguiſh Army, being then in and about that place, and the Citie flattering it ſelfe, that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> would take it into their protection, (as they had vainely deſired) and knowing the wants of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which they within ſuffered, as alſo the differences betwixt the Clergie and lay-citizens; the Clergie being much offended, that the remnant of <hi>Boninghauſh</hi> and <hi>Geleens</hi> forces was to be maintained, at their ſole charge, thought that this Citie would not long hold out, and therefore firſt attempted by batterie, to ſhake it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by blocking up the paſſages, and cutting off
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3195:50"/>their carriages, and convoyes of victuals to ſtarve it, himſelfe in the meane time not being careleſſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide food for his Campe, without which the ſouldiers would have as ſmall courage to go on, as abilitie of body to do him ſervice: Famine began to ſhew his deformed meagred viſage quickly within, the publicke Magazine was not ſo ſtored, as to affoord every man his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoſe private men which had ſtored up any thing more then need required, ſold what they could ſpare at an exceſſive rate; cheeſe, ſtockfiſh, and oates by the eighth of Iune were amounted to u quadruple peece of what they were before.

<hi>Raſhfeld,</hi> and <hi>L'Eremite</hi> aſſayed with three Regiments to breake thorow the <hi>Haſſian</hi> Army, and ſo deliver themſelues from that lingring neceſſitie. And the iſſue partly anſwered the Attempt, preſent death acquitted them of their feare, of languiſhing miſerie, which is a worſe evill, then a ſpeedie ruine. They knew, that they muſt paſſe the pikes, and fight before they could paſſe the Army, and had no hope of victory, but by a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous conflict to purchaſe their owne libertie, and fight they did valiantly, though unfortunately. The
<hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> who expected ſuch an adventure, ſtood in Battalia, and notice being given them, by their Sentinels, of the comming on of theſe Collonels, they entertained them ſo roughly, that with the loſſe of ſeven Standards, the moſt of them loſt their lives, upon their hope of liberty, they two Commanders onely, and ſome few horſemen eſcaping, to report the death of the ſouldiers to their friends at <hi>Collen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This beginning put a good hope into the friends of the Evangelicall Generall, that the Citie could not long hold out, but would certainly be quickly taken in without much time, or labour. But the accidents in warre are moſt uncertaine, the events here do not alwayes ſuite themſelues to mans hope or deſire: the ſame fate which waited upon the Romane Conſull <hi>Metellus,</hi> in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3195:51"/>warre againſt <hi>Sectorius,</hi> ſeemed to attend the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburger</hi> at

            <p>The ſurpriſall of the Haſſian Riemaſter was partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed by the States forces in the Netherlands, who being advertiſed of the returne of <hi>Auguſtine Spin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus this misfortune of theſe Catholike Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is deſcribed by them ſhortly, I will not ſtand to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it, which neither love to doe it, nor would bee thought to have a delight in inſulting over miſery. Theſe two defeats given by the Haſſians to the Leaguiſh, might ſtand for a ſufficient requitall of the loſſe which they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the Garriſon of <hi>Warendorp,</hi> in ſurpriſing of their Convoy of victuals: yet a third occaſion preſented it ſelfe, to make them the more full amends, which they neglected not, to their owne advantage, and much hurt to the Enemy. An Imperiall convoy was going out of
<hi>Weſtphalia</hi> to <hi>Collen,</hi> with 40. Laſts of corne, ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of men were appointed to guard and ſecure it from the
<hi>Luneburghers</hi> fingers. But they by their ſcowts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed thereof, made after them preſently, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them in the way, beat the convoy, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the proviſion, to the ſupplying their owne wants, and disfurniſhing of their adverſaries. And thus by the beginning of

            <p>But the ſeaſure made upon the convoy, much avayled the beſieged in <hi>Munſter,</hi> where the <hi>Luncherger</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not in that rigid manner afterward as he had done formerly. The campe wanted victuals, and ſo greats bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as an Army of 20000 men, could not, be ſuſtained with that little which was left; the Generall therefore held it fit to diſpatch away a part of his Army to a more convenient place, where the Horſes might finde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and themſelves take repaſt, and with the other to<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3195:52"/>ſtay before the Citie, and expect the iſſuing out of <hi>Boning-hauſen</hi> from under the Canons, with whom he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to meete in open champagni: and though his courſe was proſperous the one way, yet it was not ſo fruitfull the other: for the Leaguiſh Commander durſt not yet put his fortune to the Hazard, which hee knew was ſafe while he lodged under the Ordnance at <hi>Munſter,</hi> but was queſtionable if he attempted to range abroad. Once indeed he endeavoured to breake thorow the Leagner, but being driven backe to his former Hold, till the Army was quite riſen from thence, hee held it no part of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to undertake the like adventure. The forces im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed abroad, ſped better.

Hereupon the Imperialiſts which were about the River of <hi>Weſer</hi> conioyned their forces, intending to ſurpriſe the Brunſwickers in their quarters, before they were aware. But the Commiſſarie, who was no Carpet Knight, and went from the Leaguer not to follow his pleaſures, but had an eye to the maine ſtill, had alreadie brought to the Armiefoure freſh Regiments, and was himſelfe in perſon preſent at that time, though they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him abſent.

               <note place="margin">The Dukes Countermand</note> This placard being publiſhed, <hi>Iuly</hi> 22. was counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by another from the Duke, who certified his ſubjects thereby, that the Generaliſſimo had no Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Imperiall Majeſtie to take this courſe, that it was onely a device to affright them, and make them plyant to his motion, and adviſed them to continue in their faithfull obedience to him whom they had alwaies found their gratious Prince, aſſuring them alſo, that hee would never behave himſelfe otherwiſe to them, than lovingly. The people were not more diſtracted with theſe charges and countercharges, than the Generaliſſimo was perplexed with the Dukes refractory and unperſwadable obſtinacy, and that he might bring ſomething to effect, in the end hee againe ſummoned the States of <hi>Gulick</hi> and <hi>Berg</hi> to appear at
<hi>Collen</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> where he renewed his firſt propoſitions; but as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from <hi>Collen, Aug.</hi> 10/20. could not prevaile.</p>
            <p>From theſe treaties it proceeded to hoſtile actions, the Generaliſſimo forced the Citie of <hi>Mulhem,</hi> a German mile or thereabout diſtant from <hi>Collen,</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> to receive an Imperiall Garriſon, and
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninghauſens</hi> ſouldiers began to pillage the Dukedome of
<hi>Gulick,</hi> as if it had beene the enemies land, and would have proceeded to an higher pitch of violence, if the Boores had not with all their might withſtood them; but they bad them welcome in a churliſh manner, not ſtroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them lovingly, but ſtriking rudely, beating them downe with clubs, when they ſaw a fit opportunity. And theſe dealings, as it is related by the Coloners, made the<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3195:61"/>Duke after many treaties with the Marqueſſe <hi>de Aitona</hi> to require the aſſiſtance of the States of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to defend his territories.</p>
            <p>He that hath no enemy, hath no friend; and they which would comply with all, provoke him to be an adverſary, which would willingly imbrace his love. The States of <hi>Gulick</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> it is thought, and ſo expreſſed directly from <hi>Collen,</hi> would have yeelded to
<hi>Mansfields</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had not the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> in the time of the treaty, ſent them an admonition not to doe any thing which might prejudice the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Princes, leſt they ſmarted for it: and this Menace made them ſuſpitious of their friends too, not daring to entruſt themſelves with thoſe who had not formerly, (and it is to be hoped) will not hereafter offer them any violence. Some Agents for the D. had conference with the Commander in <hi>Sirburg,</hi> and it was thence conceived that the Palatine would have joyned his forces with the united Princes; but this was but a conceit, for yet he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth uncertainly, and hath not declared where he will faſten. Letters from
<hi>Collen</hi> and <hi>Duſſeldorp</hi> affirme, that not onely, while he was muſtring one company at <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim</hi> upon Tueſday, <hi>Iuly</hi>

Another ſtrange accident is related by a letter from <hi>Duſſeldorp, Aug.</hi>
2/12. the contents whereof are thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuly</hi> 31. <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. betwitxt the houres of 10. and
11, wee had here exceeding great Thunder and Lightening; the Lightening ſtrooke into a ſteeple behinde the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter againſt the Cathedrall Church, in which ſtood aboue 300 barrels of powder: the powder preſently tooke fire, and made ſuch a terrible noyſe, that it was generally thought in the City, that the end of the world was come. This one ſtroke in a moment beat in pieces about forty, or<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3195:62"/>fifty houſes, and there was ſcarce one houſe in the City, which felt not the violence thereof.</p>
            <p>The great Church and the upper part of the ſteeple, were totally ruined. In the Caſtle the glaſſe windows were all ſhattered to peeces, and many houſes utterly demoliſhed, by this one blow; a great canon was thrown from the Walls of the citie quite over the <hi>Rhine.</hi> At
<hi>Rollingen</hi> and <hi>Kayſers Werth</hi> it hath likewiſe done much harme. The people of this City were for the moſt part then in bed and at reſt, but many of them roſe no more to ſee another day. Wee have alreadie found by digging above 60 men dead, &amp; many wounded: and many more wee ſtil heare crying pitifully under the buildings, which are beaten downe. In the beginning, the City beganne to burne in three ſeverall places, but the flame was quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the induſtry of ſome people, who if they had not beſtirred themſelues, the Citie had bin utterly ruined.

            <p>The Count of <hi>Mansfeld</hi> thus diſappointed of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation in the D. of <hi>Newburgh,</hi> deſired of the city of

<hi>Rome</hi> boaſts of, is a Nurſery of treaſon, and conſpiracies, the venemous effects of cankred ſoules.</p>
            <p>But to come to our Narration. The Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth a ſuperioritie of power (how juſtly or unjuſtly, it is not here to bee controverted) and precedency in place over and before all the world, and in this Hiſtory I ſhall bee ſo favourable to her ſuite as to record her firſt, though I finde her not ſo active as paſſive adorned with robes of triumph, but mourning. The death of the Cardinall
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irile,</hi> and his ſuperſtitious buriall in the habit of Saint
<hi>Francis,</hi> put the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for a time to ſome lamentation, but his large Legacies, and penſions bequeathed by his Will 12000. crownes to one,
100. crownes yearely penſions to others, and 60 crownes given in the ſame nature to a third ſort of people, made them quickly pull the onions from their eyes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the fate, which was naturall to him, and ſo beneficiall to them. The only memorablething, which is worthy of record is this About May 13. a Friar of <hi>Ancona,</hi> named <hi>Cherubim Saraphim,</hi> of the age of 38. yeares, of the order of the Minorites, being clapt in priſon by the Commiſſaries of the inquiſition, broke out of his chaines, and by ſlipping downe by his bed-cords, for a time eſcaped. Notice hereof being brought to the Biſhop of that Sea, a Proclamation was preſently publiſhed, menacing death, confiſcation of goods, and Excommunication to all perſons; which ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale him, and promiſing 500. crownes to him that ſhould<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3195:85"/>reveale him, and deliver him into the hands of Iuſtice; The people upon this promiſe, were very carefull in the ſearch after him, the wayes were layd every where, the markes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, whereby he might bee eaſily knowne; and it was almoſt impoſſible, but that hee ſhould bee againe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<note place="margin">A Franciſcan attempteth to murder the Pope by Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</note> And yet for all this, five dayes he travailed undiſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and was gone as farre'as <hi>Rietti,</hi> a Village within two Italian, or Engliſh miles from <hi>Naples,</hi> 100 miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> when preſently hee returned to <hi>Folegni,</hi> where he had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend, in whom he repoſed much confidence, and from whom he had received many kinde letters and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, during the time of his late impriſonment; The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance betweene the Friar and the Folignian, was not unknowne to one
<hi>Martinengoe</hi> a Commiſſarie of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who ſuſpecting what the Friar intended, tooke Poſt, and came to
<hi>Foligni;</hi> about the ſame time this Fryar entered into the gates of that Citie. At his firſt arrivall he publiſhed the Proclamation made at
<hi>Rome,</hi> againſt the <hi>Minorites,</hi> ſet a ſtrong Watch, at all the gates of the Citie, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the Friar, as hee would have fled from thence, upon the markes which he was ſet out by, and there hee was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in priſon, loaden with irons, and watched narrowly, for they proceeded againſt him, ſaith the French relation, from whence I had this ſtory, leutement, not ſpeedily, but ſoftly as in matter extraordinary, and of great importance. I know not whether this Franciſcan was more wicked, or unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, more wretched by his execrable miſchiefe, or laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; (if yet, that may bee any way aſcribed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which is done by the providence and finger of God) the powers of Heaven, appeared to bee offended at his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſcape, a ſudden tempeſt of thunder and hayle, falling at the ſame minute of time, when hee broke looſe ſo furiouſly, that it beate downe foure houſes at <hi>Bracciano,</hi> to the aſtoniſhment of the people. The crime whereof hee was accuſed is this; Hee and certaine others (amongſt whom was the Nephew of the Cardicall <hi>d' Alcoli</hi>) having<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3195:86"/>plotted the death of the preſent Pope, conſpired by Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantie and Witch-craft, to take away his life, intending to have the Cardinall of <hi>Alcoly</hi> Elected to the Papacy, whom this ſhaveling affected, eſpecially as being one of his Order, and ſuppoſed would eaſily attaine to that dignitie by his faction in the Conſiſtory of Cardinals. To effect this curſed deſigne, the Conſpirators made a ſacrifice to the Divell; and offered, that ſome one of them upon whom the lotte ſhould fall, ſhould emancipate himſelfe, to the ſervice of the prince of darkneſſe, and make him Lord, both of his body and ſoule. The Lots were drawne, and hee to whoſe lot it fell to hee thus made a vaſſall to Satan, trembling at the horror, either of the fact, or his owne miſhap, fled preſently, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the practiſe to the Inquiſition, who thereupon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended theſe malefactors, clapt up the Nephew of the Cardinall, (for his ſafer cuſtody) in the Caſtle Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> and the reſt in ſeverall priſons.

Nothing was omitted here, which did but reliſh of royalty, the walls of the Pallace were as much beautified, with Symbols and artificiall inventions, to give the Helvetians delight and contentation, as the Table was ſtored with rarities to pleaſe the palate.

That controverſie which is reſolved ſatisfactorily on both ſides, was well undertaken, and it is a bleſſed warre which produceth ſo ſweet an iſſue, and is the deciſion of all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, and ground of friendly Vnion, ſuch was that betwixt his Majeſtie of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the great Duke of <hi>Moſco</hi> which at firſt though it was proſecuted with all eagerneſſe, May 29. a peace (ſome report it for 25. others for forty yeares, others for ever) was made betwixt the Princes, <hi>Pro regis Poloni, &amp; reip. dignitate,</hi> to the honour of the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> and not much to the prejudice of the Dukedome of <hi>Muſcovia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſiege of Bielha.</note> The Scene for the Warre was <hi>Bielha</hi> a Citie in <hi>Bielskia</hi> a Province of
<hi>Muſcovia,</hi> ſcituate upon the Weſt ſide of the River
<hi>Hiniſſa,</hi> upon the North ſide of the great Forreſt
<hi>Wolknoske,</hi> &amp; diſtant from <hi>Moſco</hi> about 100.
<hi>Engliſh</hi> miles. Within the Citie was a very ſtrong Garriſon, and well furniſhed Magazine of proviſion of victuals and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. The
<hi>Poles</hi> were forty thouſand ſtrong, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a valiant and wiſe Generall, well furniſhed with Militarie inſtruments, and would not for all the preparation otherwiſe deſiſt from that deſigne, which they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on, but by Mines and their Ordnance went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to effectuate their intendment, for taking of this Citie. The whole paſſages on both ſides, from the beginning of the Warre to the end, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes (if well knowne) make up a little Volume,<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3195:98"/>but I was not as
<hi>Polybius</hi> in the Warres of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> an eye-witneſſe of the Gueſts there; nor muſt I tranſcend my intelligence by imagination of what might be done occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (that might ſuite with the Poet, whoſe fancy hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to play in ſhape of truth not with an Hiſtorian tyed to his tedder, and limited without addition or ſubſtraction to relate things truly) nor muſt I looke backward to any time before May, at which time this preſented diſcovery hath it's firſt beginning. In this ſpace I finde ſome aſſaults made by the beſiegers upon the Citie, but unhappily being ſtill beaten backe with loſſe, to the griefe of the King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> who was not uſed thus to bee repulſed, when hee had undertaken a thing formerly. The beſieged made ſome ſallyes upon the aſſaylants more happily; but of all, this is the moſt memorable; About the end of Aprill, when they had played upon the Campe all day with their Ordinance, at night they ſallied ſorth by a Grotte, or Cave under the ground, fell upon the Poles in their trenches, and having ſlaine many of them, retired into the Citie, by the ſame way, which they came out, the Earth over them being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Armour of proofe to defend them from the injury of the ſhot made out of the Trenches againſt them. This was but the firſt Act which they then performed; this was preſently ſeconded with another of greater conſequence, and had the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> either not neglected, or gone on pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to purſue the occaſion, might probably have drawne the King to have offered them more honourable tearmes of agreement, then ſuch as they were glad to accept after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: The King had rayſed a Fort before the Citie, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſive for his owne Army, as offenſive to the
<hi>Muſcovites;</hi> in this hee had placed two whole Regiments, one under the command of the Colonell <hi>Donhoffe,</hi> the other under <hi>Rade Welſon,</hi> this Seonce the Garriſon underſtanding to bee at that time weakely manned, the moſt part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments being gone abroad a boote-haling, they ſet upon the next, put the Souldiers to the ſword, demoliſht the<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3195:98"/>Sconce, and carryed away the Enſignes, and all which was there remaining. A proſperous beginning, and might have given reſolvedmen hope of a wiſhed End; but opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie once ſleighted, is not eaſily recovered, and the Crowne of a Souldier is made of Mulberry leaves; called by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts <hi>Arborum ſapientiſſime,</hi> and Primroſes diſcretion muſt bee mixt with forwardneſſe, they muſt bee valiant in undertaking, and wiſe in the proſecution of their victory. Thus much they did, and did no more afterwards, as if their only ayme was to gaine their libertie; and had no hope of victory.</p>
            <p>The King much diſpleaſed with this-unſuſpected miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, put forth the worke with all meanes and ſpeed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, beſides the batteries with which hee played continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the Citie, hee prepared then three Mines to blow up the Walls thereof, which being hindered of their worke by fortune, want of skill in the Miners, and the induſtrie of the beſieged, (for the firſt was filled up by a violent ſhowre of Raine, and ſo made uſeleſſe the ſecond, when it was ſprung, recoyled backward, and ſlew foure hundred <hi>Poles</hi> in the Leaguer, without endamaging the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the laſt though it wrought it's effect, was prevented by the

The newes of this Treaty, and concluſion was welcome to the neighbour Countries, the Townes of trade eſpecially <hi>Dantzick</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and
<hi>Lubeck;</hi> In <hi>Holſt</hi> gave tokens of joy for the friendly amitie of theſe two Princes, by ſinging <hi>Te Doum,</hi> Bonfires, and diſcharging their Ordnance; But the Duke himſelfe was not ſo well pleaſed, the relinquiſhing of <hi>Smolensko</hi> a Citie upon the
<hi>Boristhenes</hi> or <hi>Nieper</hi> a place of importance, and the payment of ſo much money, upon ſo ſmall a conſideration ſo diſtaſted him, that it is ſaid hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed the Field-Marſhall, for deſcending, and yeelding to ſuch diſhonourable conditions. The execution of this ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, begot by conſequence another miſchiefe; Hee had a Nephew of a raſh fiery ſpirit, who in revenge of his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles death, hired ſome lewd fellowes made for nothing but evill, to ſet the Citie of <hi>Moſco</hi> on fire in divers places, which complying with his wicked deſire kindled that flame which could not bee extinguiſhed, untill the greateſt part of that great Citie was burned to aſhes; An horred fact; and it ſo incenſed the great Duke to anger, that hee now threatened vengeance upon all the tribe, impriſoned the Field-Marſhalls ſonne, Nephew, and all the kindred, and (if our intelligence bee true) hath already executed many of them; ſo procreative is miſchiefe, that it ſeldome is without iſſue, and though the firſt Parent be pernitious, yet the child is commonly worſe.</p>
            <p>This concluſion was farre more gratefull to the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> who beſides the benefit of diſ-ingagement from this War, had now time (and it was high time ſo to doe) to look<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3195:99"/>homeward for the ſecuritie of his owne Countrey,

<hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> a more populous Army then could be found in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and a more formidable Enemie. Preparing therefore all poſſible oppoſition the King ſent the <hi>Grand Seignieur</hi> an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to whom though there was at firſt a fayre tale told, that theſe forces were not leavied to bee imployed againſt the <hi>Pole,</hi> but the <hi>Perſian</hi> who had taken <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from the
<hi>Grand Seignieur,</hi> yet in the end, it proved a tale indeed, for the Turkiſh Vant-guard by the beginning of Iuly <hi>New Stile.</hi> were come over the <hi>Nepper,</hi> but were hindered of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe by the <hi>Pollack</hi> Field-Marſhall and <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> which ſurprized them before they were aware, put two thouſand of them to the ſword, and going further entered the <hi>Turkes</hi> Dominions, pillaging and waſting the Countrey, upon hope of preſent ſupplies from his Maieſtie, whereby they might be the better inabled to encounter ſo potent an adverſary. This fortune of the poles, ſo inraged the

<note place="margin">The Dyet at <hi>Warſhaw.</hi>
               </note> A Diet was called before this at (<hi>Warſhaw,</hi> and the Peeres aſſembled; where the King haſtening the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe propounded only three generall things to this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and inioyned them to give a ſpeedy anſwer; 1.

The beſieged cannot ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> want courage, they ſee they have no other hope of ſuccours but in the Kings clemency, and know it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to continue in his diſpleaſure, to whom it is all one to have any man his friend, or his enemy: Thus the <hi>French</hi> makes his firſt diſcourſe of the ſiege in his firſt letter, the event of which worke hee expreſſeth fully in another, bearing date Iuly 18.28. as followeth.</p>
            <p>The hearts of the inhabitants of <hi>La Mothe,</hi> are no leſſe appalled within, than their walls are valiantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted without by the Kings Army, who with patience and courage have finiſhed their workes under ground. But when the Marſhall <hi>de la Force</hi> perceived that the maine deſigne of the beſieged, was to deprive him of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any intelligence out of the City, hee reſolved to try what effect his Mines would worke, beginning with the leaſt of all, which was one of the three guided by the Commander <hi>Serres,</hi> which on the 26 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall then aſſaulting the place, was blowne up two hours before day. The Marqueſſe of <hi>Tonneins</hi> being that night in guard in the trenches, who relieved the Baron of <hi>Montſvil,</hi> and who was to bee relieved by the Vicount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> This Mine, though little in reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five Mines, was nevertheleſſe filled with 4500 weight of powder, and ſprung with ſuch impetuoſity, that it blew up all the forepart of that great Baſtion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept about a fadome, which the Marſhall <hi>de la Force</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, together with a corner of the Flancher of the ſaid Baſtion, the earth which by the violence of the powder, was blowne up into the ayre, fell into the ditch, making the acceſſe to the breach, ſo eaſie, that 25 men might enter abreſt; there was on the Baſtion when<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3195:103"/>the Mine wrought, but one Sentinell, whoſe body the next day was found bruiſed amongſt the ruines. The blow was ſo furious, that there was found an infinite number of huge ſtones a full quarter of a mile, which ſtucke deepe in the earth with violence of the fall, yet this Mine wrought ſo favourably for the beſiegers, that there was but one Sentinell of <hi>Monſieur de Franciers</hi> company ſlain thereby, who was 800 paces from thence. The deſigne of the beſiegers, beſides the inforcing the breach, was to lodge themſelves at the foot of the ruines thereof; for which cauſe the ſprung it ſo ſoone, that by the favour of the night (which was prolonged for the ſpace of an houre by the clowds of duſt) they might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. As ſoone as the Mine had wrought, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants appeared in the breach, armed with ſwords, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The beſiegers placed a great many Muskttiers on both ſides the breach for to favour their lodging, the time on both ſides being entertained with continuall skirmiſhes. The aſſaylents being thus ordered; firſt a Sergeant with 6 Souldiers armed, advanced to diſcover the breach, at the top whereof, two of them were ſlaine: but in caſe theſe had beene able to force the worke, there was appointed to ſecond them 120 more, commanded by a Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whom alſo all the Voluntieres, to the number of ſixe ſcore followed, who were men choſen out of the Army by the Commanders <hi>du Pont, de Courlay,</hi> and <hi>du Tetrenne:</hi> this troupe of Voluntieres was the flowre of the Army; for the greateſt part of thoſe Officers that were not that day in guard in the trenches, were of the number: after all theſe followed a groſe of a 100 Pikes and Muskettiers, but the breach by reaſon of the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being not to be plainely diſcovered, every man kept his ſtanding in the trenches, expecting the morning light, which no ſooner appeared, but it manifeſted unto the aſſaylants, that the advantage they had, was beyond <pb n="8" facs="tcp:3195:104"/>their expectation, wherefore they reſolved to force them preſently, advancing for that purpoſe, but the beſieged ſeeing the breach ſo eaſie to be forced (which by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame darkeneſſe of the night, they were not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne before, although they had caſt a great many fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes in the ditch, as well for that purpoſe, as alſo to ſhorte on the aſſaylants with greater facility) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to parley, and demanded for that purpoſe of the Commander <hi>Vandreour,</hi> who was in the quarter of the Vicount <hi>Arpajon,</hi> if ſome of them might come forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſecurity, which being granted unto them, they were received by the ſaid Vicount, who queſtioning with them concerning their Commiſſion, and underſtanding that they went onely with ſome complements to the Marſhall <hi>de la Force,</hi> anſwered them, that if their buſineſſe was for nothing elſe, they might ſave that labour, and conſider by what meanes they might reſiſt the Kings forces, but they finding themſelves ſurpriſed, with a neceſſity of treating, demanded an houres reſpire, promiſing in that time to returne with full power, which they did; three of the Citie comming forth for that purpoſe, to wit, the <hi>Sieur de Stinuill,</hi> ſonne to the Governour, a Sarjeant Major, and one of the principall Gentlemen of the countrey (who was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as hoſtage for thoſe that ſhould go into the City) the <hi>sieur de Vandecour</hi> being commanded to enter at the ſame time (as hoſtage for them) whileſt the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made their propoſitions (which for your ſatisfaction I will procure you) but conſidering the ſtrength of the one part, and feebleneſſe of the other, it is beleeved that they ſhall be ſuch as it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſtie to ſet downe, wherefore I ſpeake unto you as of a place alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die taken: for beſide the Marqueſſe <hi>de Tonnins</hi> (the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of whoſe Regiment (regard we either the conduct of officers or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
